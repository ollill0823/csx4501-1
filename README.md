## Introduction to Data Science

Hello again :)

This is *Tharini*, who already had a github account and doesn't remember having one at all. I must have created it during my undergraduate coding days.
If you're interested, take a look at my [design portfolio here](https://tharini.myportfolio.com/).

My initial thoughts about my data science project was to work on the causes that I care about. I wanted to work on data involving sustainable living or climate change but I'm assuming I need knowledge about GIS, Atmospheric sciences, etc which I presently do not posess.

So I'm going to start small based on my current needs. I would like my first data science project to be something like a **habit tracker** or a **bullet journal**. Instead of focusing on productivity my project will strive for accountability. I will be updating this project space along the course, feel free to suggest any ideas.
